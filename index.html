IIW Is More Relevant Than Ever
</h1>

<p>
IIW was started to discuss what was then called "user-centric identity" and a look at the <a href="proceedings.html">proceedings from past IIWs</a> will convince you that topics related to user-centric identity are a big part of every IIW. 
</p>

<p>
The recent interest in <em>self-sovereign identity</em>, <em>blockchain-based identity</em>, and related systems has pushed that conversation to a new level. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time, IIW serves as a forum for working on the identity systems and protocols that make the modern Web work such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, User-Managed Access, and Fido, to name a few.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in identity, IIW has sessions you'll be glad you didn't miss. 
</p>


	      

<h1 class="section-heading">
Come to the 26<sup>th</sup> IIW in April
</h1>

<p class="section-paragraph">
There’s many reasons for that extraordinary longevity. Here’s the top four:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing importance of IIW’s core themes –  identity, privacy, and customer empowerment.
</li>

<li>Enthusiasm of its attendees for addressing those themes.</li>

<li>Unconference format is a wonderful way to get real work done. Please <a href="assets/proceedings/IIWXXII_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">review the Book of Proceedings from the more recent IIW</a> (PDF) to see the topics we discuss.</li>

<li>Attending is exceptionally cost-effective, so IIW delivers a clear ROI.</li>

<p class="section-paragraph">
IIW brings together the largest concentration on the planet of talent dedicated to designing and building identity systems that empower individuals.
</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">
You’ll acquire the real-time pulse of genuinely disruptive technologies that are the foundation of today's important Internet movements.
</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">
IIW is at its heart a participatory conference. Through dozens of sessions, lunches, and two evening meals (all included in ticket) you’ll have plenty of chances to exchange ideas and make new professional connections. 
</p>


	        <p class="section-paragraph">This is the time and place that you get to discuss, share your knowledge, work on and learn about anything & everything related to Internet Identity today.  </p>

                <h1 class="section-heading">About IIW</h1>

                <p class="lead-iiw section-lead">IIW is an un-conference. It has no keynotes or panels, so it's about getting stuff done.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">The Internet Identity Workshop has been finding, probing and solving identity problems twice every year since 2005. Every IIW moves topics, code and projects downfield. Name an identity topic and it's likely that more substantial discussion and work has been done on it at IIW than at any other conference.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">That's because IIW is an unconference. We have no speakers, no keynotes, no panels. All sessions are breakouts, and the topics are chosen and led by participants.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">And identity is just a starting point. Many other topics come up and move forward as well. In the last few IIWs, hot topics have included personal clouds, privacy, data liberation, transparency, VRM, the Indie Web, the Internet of Things, the Semantic Web, trust frameworks, free and open devices and much more. We also make time and space available for demos.</p>

	      	      <p class="section-paragraph">IIW is cheap, as conferences go. ROI is also maximized by absence of company-driven agendas. Corporate participation is by humble sponsors who like what IIW does for the world — and to supply free meals each day and an all-day espresso bar.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">IIW takes place over three days every Spring and Fall at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. <a href="https://iiw26.eventbrite.com">Register now</a> for IIW XXVI on April 3-5. And do it soon, because it's likely to fill up. </p>
